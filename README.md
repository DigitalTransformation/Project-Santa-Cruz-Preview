# Breaking Change - Update your dev kits by 30-June 2021

After 30-June 2021, any dev kit still running a swVersion that is equal to or less than 2021.101.106.118 will not be able to complete the set up experience. **[Update your private preview dev kits](./update-your-devkit-today/private-preview-update-instructions.md) to the latest software by 30-June 2021 to avoid any disruptions resulting from this change.**

Although over-the-air updating is the primary method to keep your dev kits up to date, certain fixes in this update requires that it be completed using the USB flashing method. This is a one time process, after which you can configure your dev kit to receive all future updates over the air. Here are some resources to help you complete this task.
