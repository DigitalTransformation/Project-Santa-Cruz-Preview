## Announcement - Update your dev kit's software and firmware today

We are happy to announce that we have released updated versions of the dev kitâ€™s firmware and operating system. These updates have numerous fixes that improve the reliability and security of the device. To ensure you get the best possible experience with the dev kit, **we kindly request that you update all your private preview dev kits to the latest software as soon as possible.**

Although over-the-air updating is the primary method to keep your dev kits up to date, certain fixes in this update requires that it be completed using the USB flashing method. This is a one time process, after which you can configure your dev kit to receive all future updates over the air. Here are some resources to help you complete this task.
- Instructions for [how to update your dev kit over a USB connection](./update-your-devkit-today/private-preview-update-instructions.md)
- Instructions for [connecting to your dev kit via SSH](./update-your-devkit-today/how-to-ssh.md)
- How to get support
		- Open an Issue on GitHub
		- Attend a drop-in call to get direct support. [Click here](./update-your-devkit-today/support-sessions.md) to see the schedule of calls.

Once you've successfully updated your dev kits, please fill out this [short questionnaire](https://aka.ms/apdkppucomplete). We'd love your feedback on the update experience, plus it will to keep us from sending you email reminders.
